# AdventOfCode2021
My code in Python(or others) for the Advent of Code 2021

Sample inputs given within the problem statements are provided in ./inputs.

For individual-specific inputs and for the problem statements, go to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).

Some of these solutions have been committed as they were when I solved them.

Some have been greatly improvised with better solutions.

I'll try my best to update these solutions as and when I think of/come across interesting/efficient approaches.
